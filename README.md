# core-pairing-demo

Create a function that takes in a string and returns an integer made from the digits found in the string. For example, given “0fg3y5!78hw578!”, return 3578578.

Run the tests with

```bash
$ python3 -m pytest get_digits.py
```

Run tests with print statements with

```bash
$ python3 -m pytest -s get_digits.py
```

## Bonus Challenge #1

Solve this without ever appending or concatenating strings. (Solve this by building the number as an integer, instead of building the number as a string).

## Bonus Challenge #2

Solve this without using `isnumeric`.
