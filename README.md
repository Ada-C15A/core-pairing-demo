Create a function that takes in a string and returns an integer made from the digits found in the string. For example, given “0fg3y5!78hw578!”, return 3578578.

Bonus challenge: Solve this without ever appending or concatenating strings. (Solve this by building the number as an integer, instead of building the number as a string)
